Running:
DFS should be run with "./dfs <dir> <port>" (if directory does not already exist, may have to run with sudo privileges)
DFC should be run with "./dfc <conf_file>"
The following scripts have been provided for ease of use:
- runservers.sh: runs 4 servers on dirs/ports matching those in conf file
- killservers.sh: kills servers
- cleardirs.sh: remove files/folder from server directories

Design Decisions:
DFC halts upload of "PUT" and "MKDIR" commands if one or more servers is down. This is to prevent having to replicate the established parts later.

Extra Credits:
- Subfolders implemented (subfolder should be specified without slash in MKDIR, and with slash in other commands, as in examples from assignment)
- Traffic Optimization implemented
