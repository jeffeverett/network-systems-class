Programming Assignment 2

How to Compile Program:
Simply enter directory and run "make".

How to Run Program:
Enter directory and run ./webserver.

Configuration Details:
- "ws.conf" should be configured to point to your desired directory and to use your desired port. These changes are made by changing "Listen" and "DocumentRoot".
- Keep-Alive time is specified by "Keep-Alive" followed by an integer specifying the number of seconds to wait. This contrasts from the example "Keep-Alive time" because it is simpler to handle directives without spaces.

What's Been Implemented:
- Core requirements
- Extra credit Keep-Alive behavior
- Extra credit POST behavior

Note:
Sometimes the first series of requests to the server acts strange. Refreshing generally solves the issue.
