Make like so:
make
Run like so:
./webproxy <port> <cache_timeout>

Design Decisions:
- All cached files are stored in the ./cached directory under their md5sum hash.
- Cached addresses are stored at ./cached/cached_addresses.txt. This file
has addresses separated by newlines and host/IP separated by commas.
- blocked.txt contains all blocked hosts/IPs. Hosts go under <Hostnames> and IPs
go under <IPs>. Newlines separate entries and control information; no extra newlines
are allowed.
- Forces no keep-alive by always manually responding with "Connection: close".
